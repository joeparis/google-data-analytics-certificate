# All about thinking analytically

Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

Five key aspects to analytical thinking:

1. visualization
1. strategy
1. problem-orientation
1. correlation
1. big-picture and detail-oriented thinking

Visualization is the graphical representation of information; ex. graphs, maps, or other design elements.

Visuals can help data analysts understand and explain information more effectively.

Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there. Strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect.

Data analysts use a problem- oriented approach in order to identify, describe, and solve problems. It's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.

A correlation is a relationship between two or more separate pieces of data. Correlation **does not** equal causation.

Big picture thinking means being able to see both the details and the overall picture. For example, seeing the picture in a jigsaw puzzle without looking at all the individual pieces.

Detail-oriented thinking is the flip side of this, it's looking at how the puzzle pieces fit together while not focusing on the big picture.
