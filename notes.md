Data is a collection of facts. This collection can include numbers, pictures, videos, words, measurements, observations, and more.

Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

### Optional: Familiar with data analytics? Take our diagnostic quiz

Need >= 80% to pass.

Scored a 97.5% on the quiz, I didn't check one option on a multiple choice question (although I thought I had selected it). I got everything else correct.

#### Optional: Your diagnostic quiz score and what it means

Use your score to help you determine whether you should take the speed track. The speed track allows you to skip over the lesson material and go straight to the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which lead to your final course score. In order to earn your certificate, you will need an overall score of 80% or higher on all graded materials in this program. Read on to figure out your next steps based on your quiz score:

**If you scored 100% on the diagnostic quiz:**

* You’re probably very familiar with the fundamental concepts involved in data analytics and can take the speed track to move on to Course 2.
* You must take each of the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the certificate. To help you find these items more quickly, we’ve identified them with asterisks in the course materials (for example: *course challenge*).
* After you complete the weekly challenges and course challenge, proceed to Course 2.
* You’re welcome to review videos, readings, and activities throughout the course based on your interests.

**If you scored between 90% and 99% on the diagnostic quiz:**

* You’re probably familiar with the fundamental concepts involved in data analytics and might consider taking the speed track to move on to Course 2.
* However, we still recommend that you go through the Course 1 lesson materials to review areas where you might have some gaps before proceeding to Course 2.
* You must take each of the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the certificate. To help you find these items more quickly, we’ve identified them with asterisks in the course materials (for example: *course challenge*).
* After you complete the weekly challenges and course challenge, proceed to Course 2.
* You’re welcome to review videos, readings, and activities throughout the course based on your interests.

**If you scored between 80% and 89% on the diagnostic quiz:**

* You likely have some background knowledge on fundamental concepts involved in data analytics.
* However, we recommend that you go through the Course 1 lesson materials to review areas where you might have some gaps before proceeding to Course 2.
* You must take the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the certificate. To help you find these items more quickly, we’ve identified them with asterisks in the course materials (for example: *course challenge*).

**If you scored less than 80% on the diagnostic quiz:**

* No problem — this course was made for you!
* We strongly recommend that you go through all of the Course 1 videos, readings, and activities, as the concepts taught are building blocks that will set you up for success on your learning path.
* You must take the weekly challenges and the course challenge, which will count toward the 80% overall score needed to earn the certificate.

Regardless of your score, the course material can help you supplement or fill gaps in your knowledge. Whether you take the speed track or complete the certificate at the provided pace, good luck on your data endeavors!
