# Understanding the data ecosystem

## What is the data ecosystem?

An ecosystem is a group of elements that interact with one another.

Data ecosystems are made up of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data.

These elements include hardware, software, and the people that use them.

Or in the cloud.

As a data analyst, it's your job to harness the power of that data ecosystem, find the right information, and provide the team with analysis that helps them make smart decisions.

For example, you could tap into your retail store's database, which is an ecosystem filled with customer names, addresses, previous purchases, and customer reviews. As a data analyst, you could use this information to predict what these customers will buy in the future, and make sure the store has the products and stock when they're needed.

As another example, let's think about a data ecosystem used by a human resources department. This ecosystem would include information like postings from job websites, stats on the current labor market, employment rates, and social media data on prospective employees. A data analyst could use this information to help their team recruit new workers and improve employee engagement and retention rates. But data ecosystems aren't just for stores and offices.

They work on farms, too. Agricultural companies regularly use data ecosystems that include information including geological patterns in weather movements. Data analysts can use this data to help farmers predict crop yields.

Some data analysts are even using data ecosystems to save real environmental ecosystems. At the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, coral reefs all over the world are monitored digitally, so they can see how organisms change over time, track their growth, and measure any increases or declines in individual colonies.

### Data analyst vs data scientist

Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to existing questions by creating insights from data sources.

### Data analysis and data analytics

Data analysis and data analytics sound the same, but they're actually very different things.

Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

Data analytics in the simplest terms is the science of data. It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of managing and using data to the tools and methods that data workers use each and every day.

So when you think about data, data analysis and the data ecosystem, it's important to understand that all of these things fit under the data analytics umbrella.

## How data informs better decisions

In our everyday lives, we use data when we wear a fitness tracker or read product reviews to make a purchase decision.

In business, we use data to learn more about our customers, improve processes, and help employees do their jobs more effectively.

Data-driven decision-making is defined as using facts to guide business strategy.

Data-driven decision-making can be so powerful, it can make entire business methods obsolete.

It's important to note that no matter how valuable data-driven decision-making is, data alone will never be as powerful as data combined with human experience, observation, and sometimes even intuition.

**Subject matter experts:** people who are familiar with the business problem.

## Data and gut instinct

Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:

1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
1. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
1. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
1. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
1. **Share** data with your audience.
1. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

Other factors also influence the decision-making process.

**Gut instinct** is an *intuitive* understanding of something with little or no explanation.

Not always conscious.

### Gut instinct can be a problem

At the heart of data-driven decision making is data. Therefore, it's essential that data analysts focus on the data to ensure they make informed decisions. If you ignore data by preferring to make decisions based on your own experience, your decisions may be biased. But even worse, decisions based on gut instinct without any data to back them up can cause mistakes.

The more you understand the data related to a project, the easier it will be to figure out what is required. These efforts will also help you identify errors and gaps in your data so you can communicate your findings more effectively.

**Data + business knowledge = mystery solved**

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst.

## Origins of the data analysis process

Data analysis is rooted in statistics.

**Data analysis life cycle** — the process of going from data to decision.

There is no one "true way" but but there are some shared fundamentals in every data analysis process. .

The process presented as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate is one that will be valuable to you as you keep moving forward in your career:

1. **Ask:** Business Challenge/Objective/Question
1. **Prepare:** Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
1. **Process:** Data cleaning/data integrity
1. **Analyze:** Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
1. **Share:** Communicating and interpreting results
1. **Act:**  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem

**### **EMC's data analysis life cycle**

EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:

1. Discovery
1. Pre-processing data
1. Model planning
1. Model building
1. Communicate results
1. Operationalize

 This model, created by David Dietrich, reflects the cyclical nature of real-world projects. The phases aren’t static milestones; each step connects and leads to the next, and eventually repeats.

**SAS's iterative life cycle**

1. Ask
1. Prepare
1. Explore
1. Model
1. Implement
1. Act
1. Evaluate

***Project-based data analytics life cycle***

1. Identifying the problem
1. Designing data requirements
1. Pre-processing data
1. Performing data analysis
1. Visualizing data

***Big data analytics life cycle***

Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, *Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques*. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:

1. Business case evaluation
1. Data identification
1. Data acquisition and filtering
1. Data extraction
1. Data validation and cleaning
1. Data aggregation and representation
1. Data analysis
1. Data visualization
1. Utilization of analysis results

This life cycle appears to have three or four more steps than the previous life cycle models but in reality, they have just broken down what we have been referring to as Prepare and Process into smaller steps.
